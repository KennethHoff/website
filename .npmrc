# Always save exact versions when adding dependencies
# Without this, pnpm (and npm) default to using ^ (caret) ranges,
# which allow automatic minor/patch upgrades and can cause
# unexpected differences between environments.
#
# Example:
#   pnpm add lodash
#   -> with save-exact=false (default): "lodash": "^4.17.21"
#   -> with save-exact=true:            "lodash": "4.17.21"
#
# This ensures fully reproducible installs and makes dependency
# updates an explicit, intentional action.
save-exact=true
